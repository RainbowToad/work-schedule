# Work Scheduler

## Description

This is a simple daily schedule app that helps you keep track of your appointments. I created this to help me further my knowledge of jquery and local storage. The scheduler persists through local storage which is helpful. It also is able to be dynamic and show the time of day utilizing moment.js functions.
